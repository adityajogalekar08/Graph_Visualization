# Graph_Visualization
1) Make a private Gitlab repository and commit regularly during the coding. 
2) Install latest Node.js (better via nvm) on your computer and then install create-react-app 
3) Remove content from the main page 
4) Install react-bootstrap (it is beta, so what is not implemented -- can be written using html classes)  
5) Make a page with a header/footer (as React components) and put the graph (subtask 6) in the middle of the page (horizontally and vertically aligned). 
6) Install react-sigma and display a graph, that has nodes and edges labels.
